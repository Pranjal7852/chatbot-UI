## React TypeScript ChatUI

This repository provides a chat bot made using ReactJs in TypeScript with functional prototype as part of my learning the LFX AIFAQ projecct PoC. It includes an chat interface with streaming responses so you can see the bot type just like gradio, message history, simple styling with Tailwind, and a Netlify edge function that communicates securely with the `Hugging Face model`.
